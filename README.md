# tewke-code.github.io
Repository for hosting the prototype website at [tewke-code.github.io](https://tewke-code.github.io/#/).

## Updating Website

To update the website, the script in [Switch-Prototype](https://github.com/tewke-code/Switch-Prototype#contributing-code) can be used which compiles the current prototype version for the web, then pushes it to this repository, which Github then hosts locally.
